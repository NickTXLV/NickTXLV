- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NickTXLV
# Purpose of Code
The purpose of sharing these examples is to demostrate my ability to utilize Python/R to solve real world business problems. Many of these examples are passion projects that I've
worked on at my leisure, but do relate to real life problems that I've encountred in my normal job. 

Thanks for Checking them out!
